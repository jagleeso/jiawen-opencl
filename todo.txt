- try to make 0 spacing outperform 1 spacing (unroll loop by global size to test hypothesis that lack of 
  performance is due to cost of comparison operations)

- make sure coalescing is happening for current encryption implementation

- look into implementing a more secure version of encryption
  - counter mode? intialization vector?

- implement decryption

READ:
- Patrick/Alec/Stefan's paper on secure encryption without leaving stuff in memory
- memory management sections in Understanding The Linux Kernel
- a paper providing an OpenCL/CUDA implementation for a more secure (and usable for pages) version of AES 
  (counter mode?)
